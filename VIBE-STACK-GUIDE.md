# 🌟 The Vibe Stack Guide: Build with AI, No Coding Degree Required

Welcome to the Vibe Stack! This guide is for **vibe coders** - people who want to build real products using AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor, without needing years of coding experience.

## 🎯 What is the Vibe Stack?

The Vibe Stack is a pre-built foundation for creating web applications with:
- A beautiful user interface (what people see)
- A smart backend (the brain that processes data)
- User authentication (login/signup)
- AI integration (connect to ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- A database (where you store information)

Think of it like a pre-built house frame - you just need to add the rooms and decorations!

## 🏗️ The Big Picture: How Everything Connects

```
Your App
├── 👤 User visits website (Frontend)
├── 🔐 They log in (Authentication)
├── 📡 Frontend talks to Backend
├── 🧠 Backend talks to AI (ChatGPT/Claude)
├── 💾 Backend saves to Database
└── 📱 User sees the result
```

## 📁 Understanding the File Structure

Let's walk through each folder like exploring a new house:

### 🏠 Root Directory (The Foundation)
```
/
├── frontend/          # 🎨 What users see and interact with
├── backend/           # 🧠 The brain that processes everything
├── supabase/          # 💾 Database configuration
├── docker-compose.yml # 🐳 Runs everything together
├── Makefile          # 🎮 Simple commands to control your app
└── .env.example      # 🔑 Where you'll put your secret keys
```

## 🎨 Frontend Folder: The User Interface

**Path**: `/frontend/`

This is everything your users see and click on. Built with Next.js (a React framework).

### Key Folders Inside Frontend:

#### `/frontend/app/` - The Pages
Each folder here becomes a page on your website:
- `app/page.tsx` → Your homepage (example.com/)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → Dashboard page (example.com/dashboard)
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` → Login page (example.com/auth/login)

**🔑 Key Concept**: Folders = URLs. Create a folder, get a new page!

#### `/frontend/components/` - Reusable Building Blocks
Like LEGO pieces you can use anywhere:
- `LoginForm.tsx` - The login form used on login page
- `TextGenerator.tsx` - Component that talks to AI

**🔑 Key Concept**: Write once, use everywhere. Change the LoginForm component, and it updates everywhere it's used!

#### `/frontend/services/` - The Connectors
These files handle communication:
- `supabase.ts` - Talks to your database/authentication
- API services - Talk to your backend

**🔑 Key Concept**: These are like phone lines between your frontend and other services.

### Important Frontend Files:
- `package.json` - Lists all the tools/libraries your frontend needs
- `tailwind.config.js` - Controls the styling system (colors, spacing, etc.)
- `.env.local` - Your frontend secret keys (never share this!)

## 🧠 Backend Folder: The Brain

**Path**: `/backend/`

This processes requests, talks to AI, and manages data. Built with FastAPI (Python).

### Key Folders Inside Backend:

#### `/backend/app/api/endpoints/` - The API Routes
These are like menu items - each file handles different requests:
- `auth.py` - Handles login/logout
- `llm.py` - Handles AI conversations
- `vectordb.py` - Handles semantic search

**🔑 Key Concept**: When frontend needs something, it asks these endpoints!

#### `/backend/app/services/` - The Workers
These do the actual work:
- `llm/` - Talks to ChatGPT/Claude
  - `openai_service.py` - ChatGPT integration
  - `anthropic_service.py` - Claude integration
- `supabase/` - Database operations
- `vectordb/` - Smart search features

**🔑 Key Concept**: Endpoints receive requests, services do the work!

#### `/backend/app/models/` - The Data Shapes
Defines what data looks like:
- `llm.py` - Shape of AI requests/responses
- `auth.py` - Shape of user data

**🔑 Key Concept**: Like forms that ensure data has the right fields!

### Important Backend Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all Python packages needed
- `main.py` - The starting point of your backend
- `.env` - Your backend secret keys

## 💾 Database: Supabase

**Path**: `/supabase/`

Supabase is your database (stores user data, app content, etc.) plus authentication (handles login/signup).

- `migrations/` - Files that set up your database tables
- Each `.sql` file is like a blueprint for a database table

**🔑 Key Concept**: Migrations are like instruction manuals for building your database structure!

## 🔧 Configuration Files (The Settings)

### Docker Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Instructions for running everything locally
- `Dockerfile` - Instructions for building each service

**🔑 Key Concept**: Docker is like a recipe that ensures your app runs the same everywhere!

### Environment Files (.env)
These store your secret keys:
- `.env` - Backend secrets (API keys, database passwords)
- `frontend/.env.local` - Frontend secrets

**🔑 Key Concept**: NEVER share these files! They're like your house keys.

### The Makefile
Simple commands to run your app:
- `make dev` - Start development mode
- `make build` - Build for production
- `make test` - Run tests

**🔑 Key Concept**: Instead of typing long commands, just type `make dev`!

## 🔄 How Data Flows Through Your App

Let's follow a user asking an AI question:

1. **User types question** in the frontend (`/frontend/components/llm/TextGenerator.tsx`)
2. **Frontend sends request** to backend (`POST /api/llm/generate`)
3. **Backend receives** in endpoint (`/backend/app/api/endpoints/llm.py`)
4. **Service processes** request (`/backend/app/services/llm/openai_service.py`)
5. **AI responds** (OpenAI API)
6. **Backend returns** response to frontend
7. **User sees answer** on screen

## 🚀 Common Tasks for Vibe Coders

### Adding a New Page
1. Create folder in `/frontend/app/your-page/`
2. Add `page.tsx` file inside
3. Visit `localhost:3000/your-page`

### Adding AI Features
1. Look at `/backend/app/api/endpoints/llm.py`
2. Copy the pattern for a new endpoint
3. Use existing LLM services in `/backend/app/services/llm/`

### Changing Styles
1. Edit components with Tailwind classes
2. Or modify `/frontend/tailwind.config.js` for global changes

### Adding Database Tables
1. Create new file in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. Write SQL to create your table
3. Run `make db-apply`

## 🎓 Learning Path for Vibe Coders

1. **Start Here**: 
   - Get the app running with `make dev`
   - Visit localhost:3000 and explore

2. **First Changes**:
   - Modify text in `/frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - See changes instantly!

3. **Add Features**:
   - Copy existing patterns
   - Ask AI to help modify code
   - Test immediately

4. **Deploy**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Deploy to Railway/Vercel
   - Share with the world!

## 💡 Vibe Coder Tips

1. **You Don't Need to Understand Everything**: Just find the pattern and copy it
2. **AI is Your Pair Programmer**: Show AI the existing code and ask for similar features
3. **Start Small**: Change text, colors, add pages - then grow from there
4. **Use the Structure**: The folders are organized logically - let them guide you
5. **Break Things**: You can always restart with `make clean && make dev`
